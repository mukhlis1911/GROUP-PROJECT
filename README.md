### INTRODUCTION:

2) To ease the club members to join and programmes or activites handled by the club.
3) To notify the members and also the committees regarding any programmes that are going to be held.

### FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES: 
1) Registration function for new members, current members and committees.
2) Join function for any programmes that the user is interested to take part. 
3) Rewards and achievement page for users that has enrolled to any programmes.

### CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES:
